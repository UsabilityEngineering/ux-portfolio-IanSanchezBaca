# The time that we created wireframes for our website
## Ian Sanchez Baca 3/8/23

In this week's lab, my partner and I went on Adobe XD to create the wireframe for the project that the other three people in our team are working on. Wireframes are a very useful tool in usability engineering as they are low-fidelity, images of a project, usually a website. 

I have attached my groupâ€™s wireframe below to show what one would look like. They can even be drawn with a pencil and paper, but we chose to use Adobe XD because our goal was to make a wireframe showing what the login, calendar, and errands list pages would look like. My partner was in charge of the login and errand list pages, whilst I was tasked with doing the tedious calendar page. Thankfully, the professor gave us a short lecture on how to create boxes, circles and lines. He then taught us a neat trick where we can make a pattern with an object that you would like.  This neat trick helped greatly with making the calendar page as it provided me with a more efficient way to create multiple boxes at a time, instead of copying and pasting individual boxes at one time. 

Wireframes are an essential tool for UX designing because they allow the designer to be able to quickly draw different designs quickly and effortlessly. Once drawn they can show issues in the design early and fix them quickly and make them more effective, efficient and satisfying.
