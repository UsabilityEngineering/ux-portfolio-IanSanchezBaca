# The time that we created wireframes for our website
## Ian Sanchez Baca 3/8/23

In this week's lab, my partner and I went on Adobe XD to create the wireframe for the website that we are working on. Wireframes are a very useful tool in usability engineering as they are low-fidelity images of a project, usually a website and serve as a sort of blueprint so that when the website is being created they can look back at the wireframes as a reference.

Our goal is to be able to create an intuitive interface that would allow our users to be able to easily navigate through the app’s features and functions. Wireframes give me the ability to quickly create and test different designs without committing too much time or resources. 

I have attached my group’s wireframe below to show what one would look like. They can even be drawn with a pencil and paper, but we chose to use Adobe XD because our goal was to make a wireframe showing what the login, calendar, and errands list pages would look like. My partner was in charge of the login and errand list pages, whilst I was tasked with doing the tedious calendar page. Thankfully, the professor gave us a short lecture on how to create boxes, circles and lines. He then taught us a neat trick where we can make a pattern with an object that you would like.  This neat trick helped greatly with making the calendar page as it provided me with a more efficient way to create multiple boxes at a time, instead of copying and pasting individual boxes at one time. 

Wireframes are very useful as they are LOW-FIDELITY and do not require you to spend too much time on them. They are an essential tool for creating successful user experiences and by using them the designers can identify potential issues early in the design process. Even in the future wireframes would continue to be important to the UX design process.
