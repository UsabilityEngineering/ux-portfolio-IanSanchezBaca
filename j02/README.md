This week my partner and I were doing "User Test Procedures." We got set up by printing protocol and informed consent forms for each session and there were 5 sessions in total. We used the online chat program "Zoom" to record the participants. The final prototype can be found on the blue link at the top of this page. I can't show any of the signed paperwork that contains any user info, or videos that were recorded as the consent form informs the participant that the information will be deleted at the end of the semester. 

Our *goal* for this was to have user feedback on our prototype, and use this feedback to help our CSCI430 counterpart partners. The moderator would read to the participant the consent form and have them sign it. 

Now there are many different ways to record
